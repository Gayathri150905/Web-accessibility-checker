# Web-accessibility-checker
A **web accessibility checker** is a tool that scans websites to identify barriers that might prevent people with disabilities from accessing content. It evaluates elements like contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation, and structure. These tools help ensure compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG.
